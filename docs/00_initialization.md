## Adding New Modules

Integrating new modules into the project is a systematic process:

1. Identify the module's purpose and scope, then create a new folder in the appropriate directory (e.g., `app` for API routes).
2. Define the module's API endpoints, database interactions, and front-end components.
3. Install any specific dependencies required, ensuring they're added to `package.json`.
4. Update the `next.config.js` file to configure any new API routes.
5. Document the new module's usage and any specific instructions in the appropriate MD file.
6. Run `npm install` to update the project's package dependencies.

Remember, when in doubt, create new files and components instead of modifying existing ones. This ensures a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
